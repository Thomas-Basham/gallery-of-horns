How do I get the leftover two articles from centering themselves in the bottom and make it align with the ones above them?

What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

I was able to render certain components in their parent element rather than inside themselves which I wasn't doing yesterday.

What did I learn today?

I learned how to use the sort() method and how to use the filter() method.

What should I do differently next time?

I should sit with other students so that I can at least hear people talking about code. Today was hard because I didn't feel well on top of it being a tough class day

What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

Still pretty lost on filtering the images

### What went well, that I might forget if I don’t write down?

    Creating and rendering the modal was surprisingly intuitive once I studied the docs and made some searches

### What did I learn today?

    How to create a modal and get it to display per the event. Also, how to use the .filter() method to filter values out of an array and such.

### What should I do differently next time?

    I think today went well. I might've gotten finished faster if I was sitting alone, but I don't mind spending the extra hours on this stuff right now.

### What still puzzles me, or what do I need to learn more about?

    I'm not 100% on the syntax of the filter method so I'd like to know more about that
